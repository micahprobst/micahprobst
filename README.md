# Hi there, I'm Micah Probst 👋

## 🎓 Philosophy Graduate → AI Ethics Researcher

Recent **University of Colorado Boulder** philosophy graduate (at 19!) with a passion for **responsible AI development** and the intersection of technology and human values. I'm working to bridge philosophical frameworks with practical AI implementation to build a better technological future.

> *"I do think a better AI is possible, one that is technically and morally adequate, one that's consistent with human rights and human dignity."* — Gary Marcus

## 🔬 What I'm Working On

- 📝 **Academic Research**: Philosophical analysis of AI understanding and epistemic virtue theory
- 🤖 **AI Ethics**: Examining sycophancy, alignment, and responsible development practices  
- 💻 **Technical Projects**: Building AI systems with LLMs, RAG, and agents
- ✍️ **Writing**: Daily publication on AI, technology, and society through my Substack "Inquiry" (Coming soon)
- 📊 **Tools**: Developing AI-assisted content creation and news aggregation systems

## 📚 Current Projects

### Academic Papers (Unpublished)
- 📄 **[Beyond Binary Understanding: LLMs as Catalysts for Philosophical Recalibration](https://github.com/micahprobst/academic-papers/blob/main/beyond-binary-understanding.pdf)** (2025)  
  *A 22-page philosophical investigation examining how Large Language Models challenge traditional conceptions of understanding through analysis of Turing's behavioralism, Searle's biological naturalism, Grice's communicative intentions, and Wittgenstein's language games.*

- 📄 **[The Epistemic Vice of AI Sycophancy](https://github.com/micahprobst/academic-papers/blob/main/ai-sycophancy-epistemic-vice.pdf)** (2025)  
  *Comprehensive analysis of sycophancy in generative AI systems as a fundamental epistemic vice, examining its emergence through training processes and broader societal implications for knowledge ecosystems.*

### Technical Work (WIP)
- **Second Brain AI Assistant**: Production-ready GenAI systems (LLMs, RAG, Agents)
- **AI Safety News Briefing**: Automated news aggregation with regulatory database integration
- **LinkedIn Post Writer**: AI-powered authentic content generation tool

## 💭 Philosophy Meets Code

I believe technology should be developed with deep consideration for human values and societal impact. My work seeks to combine rigorous philosophical analysis with hands-on technical implementation to help build AI systems that are not just capable, but genuinely beneficial for humanity.

**Always interested in discussing**: AI ethics, philosophy of mind, responsible technology development, effective altruism, and collaborative research opportunities.
